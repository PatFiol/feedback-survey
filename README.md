# Feedback Customer Survey

> This project is not finished.
Currently I am working on adding more questions and make it functional.


It's based in a small tutorial. I want to make it bigger and actually convert it into a survey for customers to give their feedback in a more visual and interactive way.

I thought gifs would be a funny way to show the level of satisfaction:
