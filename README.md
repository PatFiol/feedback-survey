#  UI Feedback Customer Survey

### Phase I: Html/CSS 
Frontend interface emulating a survey to obtain feedback from customers.
Designed in a visual and interactive way to make it the most easy, fast and enjoyable experience for the users.

> This project is based in a small tutorial but I added my own styling and made it responsive.

I thought gifs would be a funny and more dinamic way to express the level of satisfaction:

### Phase II: JavaScript
Add more questions to the equation. 
1. To make it shorter even, whenever the user clicks on any of the gifs, another question appears (four in total).
2. When the user clicks their answer from the last question, a submit button pops-up.
3. When submitted, the user gets a thank you note.

### Phase III: Database
Next step is to make it fully functional and store and obtain the user's ratings.
